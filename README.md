## From assignment instructions: 
### You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

#### Observable Trend 1:

Schools that spend less money (625 or less) per student show a clear increase in test performance relative to those school that spend more (625 or more) per student. The difference is most pronounced in math scores. 

This is a counterintuitive finding, but it may be correlated to school size. In general, school that have less spending per student also have a smaller student population (see "School Summary"). Schools that are smaller tend to have better test outcomes (see "Scores by School Size"). Given this correlation, it woud be a mistake to conclude that less spending yields increased performance; rather small school sizes (and likely smaller classroom sizes) are a contributing factor.

### Observable Trend 2:

Charter schools sginificantly outperform district schools in percentage of students passing math and reading. This is not onnly true in the aggregate (see "Schools by Score Type") but in terms of individual schools. The top five performing school in the district are all charter schools (see "Top Performing Schools") and the lowest performing school are all district schools (See "Bottom Performing Schools"). 

In this case, more analysis is needed to determine the reason for this finding. The charter schools in this district tend to be smaller (though not always the case). Qualitative data is likely needed as well, as other possible explanations include teacher performance, ciriculum, and the home life of the student population. The analysis here is not enough to determine the causes behind this finding.
